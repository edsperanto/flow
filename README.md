# flow

## Problem

- I can't remember what I learned
- I don't understand the relationship between things I learned
- I need quick refreshers of old content
- I need quick access to references to get things done
- I want to build intuition of technical content

## Solution

Flow is a cross platform knowledge storage and retrieval tool. It can be quickly access via a web browser, making it a cross platform tool that requires minimal set up. Flow leverages the fact that people usually own multiple devices to create a platform that works across multiple screens to display needed content on the screen of a user's choosing easily and seemlessly.

## Structure

- Knowledge is organized by nodes, that are connect to each other in relationships
- Each node can have multiple layers of abstration, to have high level overview of stored content with increasing details as needed
- Mathematical theorems include proofs, and link to math stuff it depends on

## Example

Say you are trying to solve a physics problem. You need quick access to theorems, equations, cheat sheets, refreshers, etc. With flow, you can browse through your knowledge graph quickly by displaying content on your computer screen while controlling navigation through your knowledge graph through your iPad or phone with gestures. You can even control more than 2 screens and use extra screens to display cheat sheets for quick reference while trying to solve a problem. 

## Nice to have future features

- Markup PDFs, and jump between content like LiquidText
- Easy private content server set up
- Context switch via Brain-Computer Interface
